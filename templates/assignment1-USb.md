Assignment 1 - User Stories

## Problem Description 

We want to have a website named Travel With Us, where the purpose of this website is to buy a flying ticket to any city within Europe. The website works with multiple European travelling agencies (you are free to mention how many travelling agencies would the website deal with).

## User Stories:

###[userstory id=USa1]

As a visitor of the website, I would like to know the availability of the tickets compared with their prices, in order to better organise my travel destination for the year


###[userstory id=USa2]

As a product owner, I would like my website to be dynamic and to suit any screen device easily maintaining the style and proportions.

###[userstory id=USa3]

As a visitor of the website, I would like to have the possibility to check the top destinations on the home page, so I can get in trend with the world tourism and I can also get more travel ideas.

###[userstory id=USn4]

As a visitor, I would like to connect with people wich travel on my same route/destination, so I can socialise and meet people right away. Maybe for future plans or whatever.
